    <h2>Kennedy French</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Kennedy! I’m from Los Angeles and study journalism at Northwestern University. I fell in love with broadcast journalism as a kid, watching The Today Show before school, fascinated by the way stories could inform, connect, and shape conversations. That passion has only grown, pushing me to explore all kinds of stories—politics, pop culture, the environment, breaking news—anything that captures people’s attention and makes them think. I love the challenge of finding the heart of a story and bringing it to life, and I know that no matter where my career takes me, I’ll be telling stories for the rest of my life.</p>
