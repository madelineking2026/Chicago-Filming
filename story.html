<p>The Windy City may not be grounded in show business, but Chicago’s breathtaking landscape, from Lake Michigan sunsets to soaring skyscrapers and quaint “Chicago Bungalows,” have captured plenty of hearts and camera lenses throughout the past century of film and television endeavors.</p>

<p>The Chicago Film Office identified over 800 movies and about 450 television shows filmed in Chicago through 2024. The city has also carved out a niche in television through the "One Chicago" franchise, including long-running shows "Chicago Med," "Chicago P.D." and "Chicago Fire."</p>

<p>If you are a cinefile planning your trip to Chicago, consider it a pilgrimage to cinema’s past, present and future. From "Adventures in Babysitting" to "The Untouchables," numerous films have celebrated the architectural wonders of Chicago’s famous skyline over the past century. More recently, hit television show "The Bear" took at-home streamers and the internet by storm. Foodies flocking to Mr. Beef — the Italian beef inspiration for the show’s restaurant — may consider some nearby locations made not just famous, but forever iconic, from big-screen features. Keep scrolling to read our picks for film site visits!</p>

<p><div id="title">"The Dark Knight"</div></p>

<p>Christopher Nolan turned Chicago into Gotham City for "The Dark Knight," with some of the film’s most thrilling sequences on the city’s streets. The former IBM Building at 330 N. Wabash Ave. stood in for Wayne Enterprises, while Lower Wacker Drive hosted the high-speed showdown between Batman and the Joker. For a true Gotham experience, head to the Willis Tower Skydeck, where Batman surveyed his city from above in one of the film’s most breathtaking aerial shots.
</p>

<p><div id="title">"Ferris Bueller’s Day Off"</div></p>

<p>No trip to Chicago is complete without following in the footsteps of Ferris Bueller. The 1986 classic took audiences on the ultimate city adventure, from the Art Institute of Chicago, where Ferris and his friends admired masterpieces, to Wrigley Field, where they took in a Cubs game. Don’t forget to stop by Skydeck Chicago for the same view Ferris had from the 103rd floor and walk down Dearborn Street, where he led a parade with his unforgettable performance of Twist and Shout.
</p>

<p><div id="title">"The Blues Brothers"</div></p>

<p>"The Blues Brothers" put Chicago’s streets and landmarks in the spotlight with their over-the-top car chases and legendary musical performances. Fans of the 1980 cult classic can visit the remains of Ray’s Music Exchange at 300 E. 47th St. or grab a bite at the Soul Food Café, filmed at the historic Nate’s Deli (now gone but forever iconic). Just be sure to bring your fedora and sunglasses to complete the look.</p>

<p><div id="title">"The Untouchables"</div></p>

<p>Brian De Palma’s "The Untouchables" brought 1930s Chicago to life, using the city’s real historic landmarks to capture the era of Prohibition and Al Capone’s reign. One of the film’s most famous scenes—the intense baby carriage shootout—was filmed inside Union Station, making it a must-visit for cinephiles. Other key locations include the Chicago Board of Trade, the Michigan Avenue Bridge, and the Rookery Building, which served as the Untouchables’ office. For a true gangster-era experience, step into the Blackstone Hotel, where Capone’s chilling “teamwork” speech was filmed, or visit the Auditorium Theatre at Roosevelt University, where Eliot Ness confronts Capone.</p>

<p><div id="title">"Home Alone"</div></p>

<p>Just outside Chicago, the "Home Alone" house in Winnetka remains one of the most recognizable film locations of all time. The red-brick McCallister home at 671 Lincoln Ave. is a must-see, though visitors should be respectful, as it remains a private residence. Back in the city, O’Hare International Airport was the site of the McCallisters’ frantic race to catch their flight — a relatable moment for many travelers.</p>

<p><div id="title">"Shameless"</div></p>

<p>Chicago isn’t just a movie town, it’s also been the setting for beloved TV shows like "Shameless." The Gallagher family home, located at 2119 S. Homan Ave., is a major landmark for fans of the long-running series. While the house is privately owned, visitors often stop by to take photos from the sidewalk. Other key locations include Kevin and Veronica’s house at 2113 S. Homan Ave. and the Milkovich home at 1955 S. Trumbull Ave., all in the city’s South Lawndale neighborhood.

<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>There is evidently a laundry list of iconic filming spots dotted throughout Chicago, and the road map to film and television royalty is only expanding. Filming is a constant in Chicago. Whether it's a student film, commercial or big-budget feature film — there’s always a camera running. </p>

<p>The "One Chicago" franchise most consistently applies for filming permits, with 61.5% of 2025 filming permits associated with one of the three franchise shows. While those filming locations may strike a chord with a smaller audience, Chicago tourists from all over the country would appreciate visits to spots associated with hit shows on the rise nationally. 
</p>

<p>You could head to Logan Square to see where sci-fi thriller "Dark Matter" has filmed shots, or Wicker Park's Caton Street to catch a glimpse at the Desen family’s brownstone. The show is currently filming its second season in Chicago, so there are many more iconic spots to come. And of course, any time spent in The Loop of River North will lead you to a plethora of filming locations associated with "The Bear."</p>

<p>Chicago supports filming on all levels and for all budgets — from network TV and successful studios to student films and independent films. A new project in the works is a TV pilot for a show called "Emancipation of Limits," which shot footage at City Hall. The novel turned screenplay centers around Black Wall Street, and who knows, it could be the next big thing.  </p>

<p>Of the 788 filming permits requested this year, surely one will be the next cinema pilgrimage site. But until then, check out one of the established favorites and support your local cinema.</p>

<p><div id=methodology>
    For the past film locations map, I used lists of popular TV shows and movies filmed in Chicago found on Choose Chicago and other sites (linked in the spreadsheet found under the label "source" on the data viz) to select the 15 locations. I then plugged in the address of each filming location to Google Earth and recorded the longitude and latitude coordinates. I converted the coordinates to degrees, as that is the compatible format with Flourish. — Madeline

    For the Knight Lab Juxtapose graphic, I found a picture of the Chicago skyline in Divergent and the most similar match I could find of the actual Chicago skyline. I copied the image addresses  and compared them on a slider (the sources are mentioned in the graphic). Many of the establishing shots of the Divergent movies are taken from actual locations in Chicago but edited to fit the aesthetic of the series. The Divergent universe is a version of “post-apocalyptic” Chicago because, fun fact, Veronica Roth wrote the first draft of Divergent here at Northwestern in her creative writing sequence! — Kennedy

<p><div id=methodology>
    For the graph on upcoming Chicago film sites, I used a dataset of film permit requests from the Chicago Data Portal to develop the points on the map. The data for television shows filmed in Chicago was sorted to weed out repeated titles, so the number only considers shows, not seasons of a show, shot in the city. The 61.5% figure for One Chicago franchise film permits came from a data filter of filming permits to 2025 applications and pivot tables to determine how many of the 788 permit requests were tied to Chicago Med (52), Chicago Fire (237) and Chicago P.D. (196). For location information on Dark Matter, we referenced <a href="https://www.atlasofwonders.com/2024/05/where-was-dark-matter-filmed.html">this site</a>. — Lex

   To develop this story, Flourish was used to create the two maps, and the Knight Lab Juxtapose tool was used to create the slider.
